  description: I am a Masters student working under the joint supervision of Prof. Banerjee and Dr. Jakob Macke at Forschungszentrum caesar in Bonn, Germany. I use generalized linear models to characterize retinal ganglion cell (RGC) response by fitting these models to experimentally obtained data. The goal is to understand how RGCs behave when they are stimulated with electricity, in order to develop retinal prosthetics. These prosthetics would help alleviate blindness in people with retinal degenerative diseases.

  description: I am a BS-MS student with the Department of Physical Sciences at IISER-Kolkata. Currently I am working on bifurcation analysis of discontinuous or resetmap dynamical systems with a focus on the Izheikevich neuron model. My main interest is in the computational modeling and analysis of various physical systems from biophysics to geophysics.

  description: I primarily work in the post-Newtonian formalism using the General Relativistic model of gravitational system. Tell-tale signs of non-linearity, in the form of quasi-periodic or multi-periodic orbits around black hole systems are the focus of my work. Geodesic equations are taken as the basis and hence, this involves heavy computational work. I intend to extend my work into numerical relativity in the coming days, analyzing compact binary systems.<br><br>After completing my preliminary school education, I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Technology, specializing in Electronics and Communications. I have an ardent interest in diverse areas like Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Neural Networks, as well as Artificial Intelligence of game playing bots. Other than this, I am a puzzles and games aficionado and a competitive quizzer.

  description: I received my B.Sc degree in Physics from Visa-Bharati University in 2012. I am a 6th year Integrated PhD student in IISER-Kolkata.<br><br>I am mainly interested in three dimensional piecewise smooth systems. Systems that are not smooth can undergo bifurcations that are forbidden in smooth systems, such as border collision bifurcations and robust chaos. I have also studied synchronization in periodic oscillators.

  description: I obtained my Bachelors and Masters Degree in Physics from the University of Burdwan, West Bengal, India in 2012 and 2014 respectively. I joined as a guest faculty in the Electronics Department at Burdwan Raj College under the University of Burdwan in 2014. I am now pursuing research and Teaching Assistantship (TA) in different courses with the Department of Physical Sciences at IISER Kolkata. My work is funded by the INSPIRE Scholarship and INSPIRE Fellowship (given by DST).<br><br>My research involves investigating bifurcation phenomena in piecewise smooth systems experimentally. Currently, I am studying multiple attractor bifurcation phenomena, in a real electronic system that gives rise to a 2D piecewise smooth system.
